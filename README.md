# Rain Alert Project using Openweather Map and Twilio API 

This is a project that communicates with the open Weather Map(OWM) onecall endpoint https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall to check through the hours of
the day and send an SMS alert to your phone with the message, "It's going to rain today. Bring an umbrella â˜”"

The Twilio api( a communication api for sms, voice, video)  was used for sending the SMS messages. This was done through importing the twilio rest API. https://www.twilio.com/

To find weather for your location, the latitude and longitude was used of the region one stays in is required. 
Which can easily be picked from https://www.latlong.net/
